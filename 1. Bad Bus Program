You are making a program for a bus service.
A bus can transport 50 passengers at once.
Given the number pessengers waiting in the bus station as input, you need to calculate and output how many empty seats the last bus will have.

Sample Input:
126

Sample Output:
24

Explanation:
The first bus will transport 50 pessangers, leaving 126-50=76 in the station. The next one will leave 26 in the station, the last bus will take all the 26 passengers,
having 50-26=24 seats left empty.
